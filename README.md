# dotfiles

Just a repo to save and reference my configuration files.

## deploy
`deploy.sh` is a WIP shell script to create the directories needed and symlink my files  to them.

It is inspired by [Alexey Kutepov](https://github.com/rexim)'s [repo of his own dotfiles](https://github.com/rexim/dotfiles).
